## Introduction

Thanks [Haotong Lin](https://github.com/haotongl) for providing the clean version of PVNet and reproducing the results.


## Installation

1. Set up the python environment:
    ```
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # install torch 1.1 built from cuda 10.2
    pip install torch==1.1.0 torchvision==0.2.1

    pip install Cython==0.28.2
    sudo apt-get install libglfw3-dev libglfw3
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. Compile cuda extensions under `lib/csrc`:
    ```
    ROOT=/path/to/clean-pvnet
    cd $ROOT/lib/csrc
    export CUDA_HOME="/usr/local/cuda-10.2"
    cd dcn_v2
    python setup.py build_ext --inplace
    cd ../ransac_voting
    python setup.py build_ext --inplace
    cd ../nn
    python setup.py build_ext --inplace
    cd ../fps
    python setup.py build_ext --inplace

    # If you want to use the uncertainty-driven PnP
    cd ../uncertainty_pnp
    sudo apt-get install libgoogle-glog-dev
    sudo apt-get install libsuitesparse-dev
    sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev
    python setup.py build_ext --inplace
    ```
3. Set up datasets:
    ```
    ROOT=/path/to/clean-pvnet
    cd $ROOT/data
    ln -s /path/to/custom custom

    ```
## Training on the custom dataset and object

1. Use [NDDS](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Dataset_Synthesizer) to generate a custom dataset with your own 3D-Modell (.fbx-file) containing the following:
 - rgb-Image
 - segmentation mask
 - annotations (generated by using NVCapturableObject-tag inside UE4)

2. Process the dataset:
    ```
    python run.py --type custom
    ```
	Here you will be asked on which class you wish to train and on how many pictures from your dataset. The class has to be the same classname as in your annotations!

3. Train:
    ```
    python train_net.py --cfg_file configs/custom.yaml train.batch_size 4
    ```
	The trained models can be found in this folder: 'data/model/pvnet/custom'
4. Watch the training curve:
    ```
    tensorboard --logdir data/record/pvnet
    ```
5. Visualize:
    ```
    python run.py --type visualize --cfg_file configs/custom.yaml
    ```
6. Test:
    ```
    python run.py --type evaluate --cfg_file configs/custom.yaml
    ```
